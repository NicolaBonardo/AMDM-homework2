    "Now we can describe the mechanism of the algorithm. The algorithm is recursive: the function *splitSwap* consists of 4 steps:\n",
    "* first of all, it checks if the length *n* is lower than 2: in that case, it returns to the caller. In fact, if the part to reverse has a length of 1, nothing more has to be reversed;\n",
    "* then the function *splitSwap* itself is called twice: in both cases the length of the part to reverse is divided by 2; the two calls differ on the index of the starting point - *l* in the first case, *l+n/2* in the second one; according to the effect of the function, the effect of these 2 calls is that the two halves of the part to reverse are reversed **separately from each other**;\n",
    "* the fourth and last step is the call of the subroutine *swapList*. This subroutine takes the same arguments of its caller, *splitSwap*: an array *a*, an index *l* and a length *n*; its effect is to consider the sub-array stsrting from index *l* and of length *n*, **to divide it into 2 halves and to swap them**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall behaviour of the algorithm can therefore be described in this way: when the function *splitSwap* acts on a given array *a*, it takes the part of the array going from the index *l* and of length *n*, divides this subarray into 2 parts, then it separately reverses the 2 parts and then, finally, the two reversed parts are swapped. The reversal of the 2 halves is made recursively: each one is divided into 2 halves, that are separately reversed and the swapped, and so on.\n"
