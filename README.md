# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining
## Repository for the Homework 2 - Group#36

In this repository you will find the Soccer Analytics and the Theoretical exercise for the Homework 2 of Group #36 (Nicola Bonardo)

The work is far from complete: some points of the soccer analytics are missing; I would have commented far way better the passes of my analysis. Plots are not of the level I had in mind: labels, titles, legends are often missing and sometimes there are problems with dimensions of the plot, and out-of-bound graphics. 

I am aware that the work is not complete, but I decided to submit it anyway, because I spent time on it and it represents only a step towards improving.

This said, the repository is made up of:
* this README.md markdown file
* a main.ipynb Jupyter notebook, for the soccer analytics part
* a theory.ipynb Jupyter notebook, for the theoretical exercise part
